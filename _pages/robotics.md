# Embodied Intelligence (Robotics)

This repository showcases projects from my work at the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), where I focused on tactile recognition and robotics. Under the leadership of Dr. Zhengkun Yi, the head of our research group, I collaborated closely with both Dr. Yi and Dr. Meng Yin. During this time, I also worked closely with my master's thesis advisor, Dr. Putra Sumari.
